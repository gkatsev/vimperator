<p>
    <em>NOTE:</em> Vimperator will stop functioning with Firefox 57!
</p>

<p>
    Firefox 57 will change its add-on ecosystem to be exclusively based on
    <link topic="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/">WebExtensions</link>.
    While this offers (some) compatibility with extensions written for Chrome
    and Microsoft Edge, it removes the possibility to do many advanced stuff
    which Vimperator does. Additionally, it would require a full rewrite of
    Vimperator, which nobody has volunteered for. Therefore we will stop
    supporting any Firefox version later than Firefox 56. Head over to our
    GitHub page for
    <link topic="https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs#end-of-life-and-alternatives">a list of alternatives</link>
    or <link topic="https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues/705">a detailed discussion</link>.
